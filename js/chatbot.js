1. What to Expect:
   - Most dripping occurs from door seams
   - We use a dripless formula for most areas
   - Some dripping is normal and expected in the first 24 hours
   - This is from the product working its way into seams and cavities

2. First 24 Hours Parking:
   - DO NOT park on:
     ‚Ä¢ Sealed driveways
     ‚Ä¢ Decorative concrete
     ‚Ä¢ Interlocking brick
     ‚Ä¢ Any surface you don't want product on

3. Recommended Parking:
   - Use a gravel driveway if possible
   - Park on grass or dirt area
   - Use street parking if allowed
   - Avoid your garage for 24 hours

4. After 24 Hours:
   - Dripping will stop
   - Safe to park anywhere
   - No further precautions needed
   - Normal use can resume
